# Application of KubeEdge Edge Computing in SF Tech's Industrial IoT

## Development of Industrial IoT and Edge Computing

Industrial IoT (IIoT) was first introduced by **General Electric (GE)** in 2012 with the launch of the **Predix platform**. In China, the government published the **Smart Manufacturing Development Plan (2016-2020)** in 2015, emphasizing major strategies in intelligent manufacturing. By September 2020, China further accelerated **digital transformation** among state-owned enterprises. As an enabler of **smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0**, Industrial IoT requires the **convergence of Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT)**. However, integrating these two domains presents several challenges, primarily in the following aspects:

- **Differences between OT and IT:**
  - OT prioritizes **stability and reliability**, and OT personnel tend to avoid frequent changes to running systems.
  - IT focuses on **data processing speed, system reliability, and security**, requiring continuous innovation to keep up with evolving technologies.
- **Organizational and Implementation Challenges:**
  - Who should lead the integration?
  - What is the implementation scope?
  - What measurable benefits can be achieved?

As the **bridge between OT and IT**, Industrial IoT relies on multiple supporting technologies, including **industrial automation, sensor networks, ubiquitous connectivity, edge computing, cloud computing, big data analytics, and industrial data modeling**. These components collectively build the **Industrial IoT ecosystem**.

Industrial IoT architecture varies based on use cases but generally consists of five layers:

- **Perception Layer**: Responsible for **data acquisition** from industrial equipment, sensors, and heterogeneous systems.
- **Edge Computing Layer**: Handles **real-time processing, analysis, and data filtering** before transmitting data to higher layers.
- **Network Layer**: Establishes **wired or wireless connectivity** between edge nodes and cloud infrastructure.
- **Platform Layer**: Provides **Industrial PaaS capabilities** such as data ingestion, analytics, and application templates.
- **Application Layer**: Delivers **business-specific solutions**, integrating with ERP, WMS, CRM, and other enterprise systems to eliminate data silos.

## Three Key Problems Addressed by Edge Computing in IIoT

Currently, **edge computing** in Industrial IoT aims to address the following challenges:

1. **Real-time Data Processing**: Ensuring real-time monitoring and control in industrial operations. **SF Tech** has actively explored OT-IT integration and IIoT applications, overcoming obstacles related to **network infrastructure, personnel training, cost, and legacy system compatibility**.
2. **Network Security and Reliability**: Addressing concerns such as **limited bandwidth, connectivity disruptions, and cybersecurity risks**.
3. **Trends Driving Adoption**:
   - **Increased device connectivity** across industrial environments.
   - **Growing demand for efficiency, quality, and cost optimization**.
   - **The gradual convergence of OT and IT ecosystems**.

## How SF Tech Solves These Challenges

Given the **convergence of OT and IT**, how can we leverage **cloud-edge collaboration, edge data collection, and edge data cleansing** to meet the demands of real-time decision-making and security?

Industrial operations inherently require **real-time processing**. The **adoption of edge computing** is becoming natural as **hardware processing capabilities improve**. However, OT systems often lack agility, and industrial **automation control systems** remain heavily reliant on **on-site engineering teams**. Deployment, upgrades, and system modifications in traditional **single-machine architectures** can cause significant disruptions.

### **Key Benefits of Edge Computing**

- **Integrates OT and IT** while ensuring system stability.
- **Reduces latency** by processing data closer to its source.
- **Enhances security** by limiting exposure to cloud environments.
- **Supports automation** without disrupting existing workflows.

## Application of KubeEdge in SF Tech

To implement edge computing, **SF Tech** adopted **KubeEdge**, an open-source edge computing platform, as the foundation for **edge node management and edge application orchestration**. Building on its **expertise in IoT device management and data processing**, SF Tech established a **leading framework for cloud-edge collaboration**.

### **Key Achievements**

1. **Built a pervasive sensing network**:
   - Directly connects to heterogeneous industrial devices.
   - Bridges gaps between OT production systems and IT environments.
2. **Applied IoT technology to logistics and supply chains**:
   - Enhanced automation in sorting centers.
   - Improved tracking and monitoring across transport networks.
3. **Standardized digital monitoring and intelligent management**:
   - Supported automated production and efficiency control.
   - Strengthened data-driven decision-making.

Ultimately, **SF Tech's Industrial IoT architecture** enables **continuous digital transformation** by improving automation, reducing costs, and driving operational excellence.
