# China Mobile PanZhou PanJi Platform KubeEdge Implementation

## Introduction

The **PanZhou Integrated Cloud Delivery Platform** is a self-developed platform by **China Mobile**, designed for **code development, automated deployment, and continuous integration**. It features an **in-house GitOps engine** that enables seamless **application deployment on the PanJi container cloud platform**.

The **PanJi container cloud platform** is an enterprise-grade **PaaS solution based on Kubernetes**, offering:

- **Standardized Kubernetes capabilities**
- **Development & runtime environments**
- **Elastic resource scaling**
- **Fine-grained microservice management**
- **One-stop service deployment**
- **Cross-region multi-cluster scheduling**
- **Intelligent monitoring and maintenance**

PanZhou and PanJi work **seamlessly together**:

- Developers use **PanZhou clusters for development**.
- Applications are **deployed on PanJi PaaS clusters**.
- GitOps is used to **manage and deploy configurations** on PanJi clusters.

## Managing Multi-Region Clusters

With China Mobile’s **adoption of domestic infrastructure**, large-scale **Kunpeng-powered clusters** are deployed across multiple regions. **Key challenges include:**

- **Managing 500+ ARM servers** while maintaining **dual-architecture (x86/ARM) support**.
- **Frequent Kubernetes cluster operations**—over **800 cluster creations and deletions in two months**.
- **Manual deployment bottlenecks**:
  - Developers create images on **PanZhou Kubernetes clusters**.
  - Manual deployment via **multi-hop SSH tunneling** to **province-level Kubernetes clusters**.
  - Inefficient, non-automated workflow.

### Key Considerations

1. **Unifying Kubernetes clusters?**

   - Not feasible due to **business-specific requirements** in each province.

2. **Implementing Kubernetes Cluster Federation?**

   - **High latency across provinces** makes federation **resource-intensive**.
   - **Direct SSH access to province clusters is simpler**.

3. **Maintaining manual SSH-based workflows?**
   - **Manual shell script maintenance is inefficient**.
   - **Not aligned with cloud-native best practices**.
   - **Contradicts PanZhou-PanJi’s vision of seamless cloud migration**.

## The "1+31+N" Model

To improve **flexibility, automation, and efficiency**, China Mobile designed a **“1+31+N” network model**:

- **1 central cluster**
- **31 province-level clusters**
- **N edge clusters**
- **Network isolation between regions**

This approach ensures **automated, cloud-native management** while maintaining **GitOps-based deployment** across clusters.

To implement this, **KubeEdge was selected** as the core edge computing solution.

## KubeEdge Implementation in PanZhou-PanJi

By aligning **KubeEdge** with **China Mobile’s “1+31+N” model**, the architecture was mapped as follows:

- **Central (Group-level) Kubernetes cluster** → KubeEdge **CloudCore**
- **Province-level Kubernetes clusters** → KubeEdge **EdgeCore nodes**

### **1) Cluster Deployment & GitOps Automation**

- The **Group Kubernetes master node** acts as **CloudCore**.
- **Province nodes** function as **EdgeCore**.
- **ArgoCD pods** are deployed at the **EdgeCore** nodes.
- GitOps **automates metadata distribution** across province-level clusters.

### **2) Automated Cluster Creation**

- **PanJi PaaS clusters** are automatically created at **province-level resource pools**.
- Operators use **PanZhou GitOps** to deploy **OpenEuler-based Eggo tools**.
- Eggo enables **automated Kubernetes cluster provisioning** at the **edge**.

## Results & Benefits

By integrating **KubeEdge into the PanJi PaaS platform**, China Mobile successfully:

- **Unified networking** across **1+31+N Kubernetes clusters**.
- **Streamlined cluster management** and **reduced operational costs**.
- **Automated provisioning** of **500+ Kunpeng ARM servers** and **BC-Linux for Euler clusters**.
- **Significantly improved operational efficiency**.

## Future Roadmap for Multi-Cluster Management

Following the success of **KubeEdge integration**, China Mobile aims to:

1. **Extend automation to control planes**
   - Multi-node **southbound clusters** will be **automatically provisioned**.
2. **Implement CNCF’s Karmada for Cluster Federation**
   - Further improve **“1+31+N” multi-cluster unified management**.

By leveraging **KubeEdge and Karmada**, China Mobile will continue to **enhance cloud-native multi-cluster orchestration** and **scale Kubernetes across its vast infrastructure**.
