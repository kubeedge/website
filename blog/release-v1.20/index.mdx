title: KubeEdge v1.20 is live!
---

On January 21, 2025, KubeEdge released v1.20. The new release has enhanced the capabilities of managing and operating edge nodes and applications for large-scale, offline and other edge scenarios. At the same time, it has added support for the multi-language Mapper-Framework.

- [Upgrade Kubernetes Dependency to v1.30.7](#upgrade-kubernetes-dependency-to-v1307)

## Release Highlights

### Support Batch Node Process

Previously, the keadm tool of KubeEdge only supports manual single-node management. However, in edge scenarios, the scale of nodes is often very large, and the management process of a single node can no longer cope with such large-scale scenarios.

In v1.20, we have provided the batch node operation and maintenance capability. With this capability, users only need to use one configuration file to perform batch operation and maintenance on all edge nodes through a control node (which can log in to all edge nodes). The supported operation and maintenance capabilities include join, reset, and upgrade.

```json

  download:
    enable: true              # <Optional> Whether to download the keadm package, which can be left unconfigured, default is true. if it is false, the 'offlinePackageDir' will be used.

### Multi-language Mapper-Framework Support

To further reduce the complexity of developing custom Mapper, in this version, KubeEdge provides the Java version of Mapper-Framework. Users can access the KubeEdge `feature-multilingual-mapper` branch to use Mapper-Framework to generate a Java version of custom Mapper project.

Refer to the link for more details.([#5773](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/5773), [#5900](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/5900))

### Support Pods logs/exec/describe and Devices get/edit/describe Operation at Edge Using `keadm ctl`

In v1.17, a new command `keadm ctl` has been introduced to support pods query and restart at Edge. In this release, `keadm ctl` supports more functionality including `pod logs/exec/describe` and `device get/edit/describe` to help users operate resources at edge, especially in offline scenarios.

```
[root@edgenode1 ~]# keadm ctl -h
Commands operating on the data plane at edge

Usage:
  keadm ctl [command]

Available Commands:
...
  describe    Show details of a specific resource
  edit        Edit a specific resource
  exec        Execute command in edge pod
  get         Get resources in edge node
  logs        Get pod logs in edge node
...
```

Refer to the link for more details.([#5752](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/5752), [#5901](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/pull/5901))

### Decouple EdgeApplications from NodeGroups, Support Node Label Selector

EdgeApplication can be overrides deployment spec(i.e. replicas, image, commands and environments) via the node group, and pod traffics are closed-loop in a node group(Deployments managed by EdgeApplication share a Service). But in the real scenario, the scope of nodes that need batch operations is different from that of nodes that need to collaborate with each other.

We add a new targetNodeLabels field for node label selectors in the EdgeApplication CRD, this field will allow the application to deploy based on node labels and apply overrides specific to those nodes.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kubeedge.io/v1alpha1
kind: EdgeApplication
metadata:
  name: edge-app
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: my-app-image:latest
  # New field: targetNodeLabels
  targetNodeLabels:
    - labelSelector:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: "region"
              operator: In
              values:
                - "HangZhou"
    overriders:
      containerImage:
        name: new-image:latest
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "500m"
          memory: "128Mi"
```

### CloudHub-EdgeHub Supports IPv6

We provide a configuration guide in the documentation on the official website, which is how KubeEdge enables the cloud-edge hub to support IPv6 in a K8s cluster.

Refer to the document https://kubeedge.io/docs/advanced/support_ipv6

### Upgrade Kubernetes Dependency to v1.30.7

Upgrade the vendered kubernetes version to v1.30.7, users are now able to use the feature of new version on the cloud and on the edge side.

Refer to the link for more details. ([#5997](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/issues/5997))

## Important Steps before Upgrading

- From v1.20, the default value for the EdgeCore configuration option `edged.rootDirectory` will change from `/var/lib/edged` to `/var/lib/kubelet`. If you wish to continue using the original path, you can set `--set edged.rootDirectory=/var/lib/edged` when installing EdgeCore with keadm.
