# Embodied Intelligence meets KubeEdge-Ianvs: Industrial Assembly Benchmarking

This blog introduces how to enable comprehensive embodied intelligence benchmarking for industrial manufacturing using the KubeEdge-Ianvs framework.

## Why Embodied Intelligence Benchmarking for Industrial Manufacturing?

The manufacturing industry is experiencing a profound transformation driven by intelligent robotics, adaptive production lines, and precision assembly systems. Modern industrial environments demand more than basic task execution—they require multimodal perception, force-controlled manipulation, and real-time quality verification integrated into cohesive workflows.

### A First-of-Its-Kind Benchmark Addressing Critical Gaps

Despite growing interest in Embodied Intelligence for manufacturing, the research community faces a critical shortage of benchmarks that evaluate real-world industrial assembly scenarios. Existing work falls short in several key areas:

#### Current Limitations in the Field:

- **Isolated Task Focus**: Popular benchmarks like YCB and OCRTOC evaluate individual capabilities (grasping, object detection) but don't assess how these integrate in multi-stage industrial workflows
- **Missing Deformable Component Coverage**: While NIST has developed benchmarks for rigid components and simple deformable objects (cables, belts), existing datasets don't support multiple representations of deformable objects with different self-occlusions typical in manufacturing [PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)
- **No Electronic Assembly Benchmarks**: Despite datasets for PCB defect detection (BoardVision, FICS-PCB) and component recognition (ElectroCom61), none evaluate robotic assembly of electronic components, particularly those requiring precision force control
- **Academic-Industry Gap**: A large gap exists between embodied AI in academic research and what manufacturers can feasibly implement [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/), with limited benchmarks that mirror real production challenges

#### What Makes This Project Unique:

This work represents the **first comprehensive benchmark** for robotic assembly of deformable electronic components—a scenario ubiquitous in modern electronics manufacturing yet completely absent from existing research infrastructure. Our contributions are unprecedented in scope:

1. **First Multimodal Industrial Assembly Dataset**: To our knowledge, no publicly available dataset combines RGB-D vision, force/torque sensor data, and robot trajectories for electronic component assembly.

2. **First Deformable Electronics Benchmark**: Existing deformable object benchmarks focus on textiles (GarmentLab), food items, or abstract shapes. This is the first benchmark specifically designed for deformable electronic components like flexible circuits and memory modules—components that require both precision alignment and compliance control.

3. **First End-to-End Assembly Workflow Evaluation**: Unlike fragmented benchmarks that test perception OR manipulation OR verification separately, we evaluate complete assembly pipelines. This mirrors how industrial systems actually operate, where failure in any stage cascades to overall task failure.

4. **Practical Manufacturing Relevance**: Our five assembly scenarios (RAM modules, cooling mounts, CPU sockets, flexible circuits, security chips) represent actual production challenges in electronics manufacturing—an industry segment worth over $2 trillion globally that currently relies heavily on manual assembly due to lack of validated automation solutions.

### Addressing Real Industrial Needs

The electronics manufacturing sector faces mounting pressure to automate assembly operations involving:

- Sub-millimeter positioning tolerances (CPU socket assembly: 55% accuracy in our baseline)
- Deformable components requiring force adaptation (flexible circuits: 70% accuracy baseline)
- Quality verification at component scale (current detection: 91.19% mAP50)

Manufacturers need streamlined ways of assessing the productive impact of AI systems through AI-specific productivity metrics and test methods [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/). This benchmark directly addresses that need by providing:

- **Realistic Industrial Scenarios**: Deformable component assembly representing real manufacturing challenges
- **Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset**: RGB-D images, force/torque sensor data, and robot trajectories—the complete sensor suite used in production environments
- **End-to-End Evaluation**: Metrics that assess entire workflows, not just individual subtasks, revealing integration challenges invisible to component-level testing
- **Reproducible Infrastructure**: Standardized test environments and baseline algorithms that enable fair comparison across different robotic systems

By combining distributed AI benchmarking framework KubeEdge-Ianvs with this domain-specific industrial dataset, we enable objective comparison of robotic systems on tasks that mirror real-world manufacturing complexity—bridging the gap between academic research and industrial deployment while accelerating the development of reliable autonomous assembly systems.

## Benchmark Configuration

The benchmark is organized following the Ianvs framework structure:
```
ianvs/examples/industrialEI/single_task_learning_bench/
└── deformable_assembly/
    ├── testalgorithms/
    │   └── assembly_alg/
    │       ├── components/
    │       │   ├── perception.py          # YOLOv8 detection + CNN inspection
    │       │   └── manipulation.py        # Force control algorithms

    │       └── naive_assembly_process.py  # Workflow orchestration
    ├── benchmarkingjob.yaml
    └── README.md
```

### Configure Dataset Paths

The dataset path is pre-configured in `testenv.yaml`. Set up the algorithm path:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/ianvs/examples/industrialEI/single_task_learning_bench/deformable_assembly/testalgorithms/assembly_alg
```

The configuration defines the complete test environment including:

- Dataset locations and splits
- Simulation parameters
- Sensor configurations
- Performance metrics

---

## Algorithm Integration

The benchmark implements a **multi-stage single-task paradigm** that orchestrates three sequential modules:

### 1. Perception Module (`perception.py`)

Uses YOLOv8 for real-time component detection:

- Identifies component locations on the assembly panel
- Provides bounding boxes with confidence scores
- Extracts orientation information for grasping

### 2. Manipulation Module (`manipulation.py`)

Implements force-controlled assembly operations:

- Executes precise grasping based on detection results
- Uses haptic feedback for delicate component handling
- Adapts to deformation during flexible circuit placement
- Monitors force/torque to prevent damage

### 3. Verification Module (`perception.py`)

CNN-based visual quality inspection:

- Captures final assembly state
- Detects misalignments and defects
- Generates pass/fail classifications

The entire workflow is orchestrated by `naive_assembly_process.py`, which executes these stages sequentially for each component type.

---

## Run Benchmarking

Execute the benchmark from the Ianvs root directory:
```bash
cd /ianvs
ianvs -f examples/industrialEI/single_task_learning_bench/deformable_assembly/benchmarkingjob.yaml
```

The benchmark will:

1. Load the multimodal dataset with all sensor modalities
2. Run YOLOv8 detection on each frame for component localization
3. Execute force-controlled assembly in PyBullet simulation
4. Perform CNN-based visual inspection on assembled products
5. Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
6. Generate detailed reports and leaderboards

---

## Analyze Results

Results are available in the output directory (`/ianvs/industrialEI_workspace`) as defined in `benchmarkingjob.yaml`.
