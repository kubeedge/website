## **Who can participate ?**

As majority of KubeEdge contributors are currently from Huawei organization, KubeEdge maintainers want to encourage other individuals, hence any commits done from Github accounts which are based on huawei domain will not qualify in participation. Other than non-huawei domain all other commits are considered. Hence this contest is open for any individuals.
