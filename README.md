# Creating and updating the KubeEdge docs

Welcome to the GitHub repository for KubeEdge's public website. The docs are
hosted at https://kubeedge.io.

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to format and generate our website, and
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site. Docusaurus
is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content
organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine.
You write the pages in Markdown, and Docusaurus wraps them up into a website.

## Quick start

Here's a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you're familiar with the
GitHub workflow and you're happy to use the automated preview of your doc
updates:

1. Fork the [KubeEdge/website repo][kubeEdge-website-repo] on GitHub.
2. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).
3. If you're not yet ready for a review, add a comment to the PR saying it's a
   work in progress or add `[WIP]` in your PRs title. You can also add `/hold` in a comment to mark the PR as not
   ready for merge. 
4. Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready,
   you should see a comment like this: **deploy/netlify â€” Deploy preview ready!**
5. Click **Details** to the right of "Deploy preview ready" to see a preview
   of your updates.
6. Continue updating your doc until you're happy with it.
7. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR and assign a
   reviewer/approver. See the
   [Kubeedge contributor guide][kubeedge-contributor-guide].

## Previewing your changes on a local website server

If you'd like to preview your doc updates as you work, you can install Node.js
and run a local server. This section shows you how.

### Install Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) version 16.14 or above required, please see more details for [Node.js official supported version](https://endoflife.date/nodejs).

> [!NOTE]
> Aligned with [official download](https://nodejs.org/en/download), using `nvm` and `npm` installation is recommended.

- using `nvm` with `npm`

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 22
node -v
```

If you want to install `apt` package on Ubuntu.

- `apt`

```shell
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
node -v
```

### Install yarn

- `npm`

```shell
npm install -g yarn
```

- `apt`

```shell
curl -sL https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y yarn
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
cd website
yarn
```

### Local Development

```shell
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

Your website is at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). (You can also use `--host` option to bind the IP address instead of `localhost`.)

### Build

```shell
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Using Container

### Docker

```shell
docker build -t kubeedge:website -f Dockerfile .
docker run -it --network host --rm -v $(pwd):/tmp/doc_repository kubeedge:website /bin/bash
yarn start
```

### Devcontainer

Once you open the vscode with `devcontainer`, you can see the following terminal.

```shell
Running the postCreateCommand from devcontainer.json...

[12035 ms] Start: Run in container: /bin/sh -c yarn install
yarn install v1.22.22
[1/5] Validating package.json...
[2/5] Resolving packages...
success Already up-to-date.
Done in 0.24s.
Running the postStartCommand from devcontainer.json...

[14333 ms] Start: Run in container: /bin/sh -c /bin/bash
kubeedge@be52334d349c:/tmp/doc_repository$
```

## Versioning

For each stable release, we should create a new branch for the relevant documentation. For
example, the documentation for the v0.1 stable release are maintained in the
[v0.1-branch](https://github.com/kubeedge/website/tree/v0.1-branch).
Each branch has a corresponding netlify website that automatically syncs each merged PR.

Going forward, the versioned sites should follow this convention:

- `https://kubeedge.netlify.com/` always points to the current _master branch_
- `https://master.kubeedge.netlify.com/` always points to Github head
- `https://vXXX-YYY.kubeedge.netlify.com/` points to the release at vXXX.YYY-branch
