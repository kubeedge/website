Kubernetes is not a prerequisite for using KubeEdge, but understanding Kubernetes concepts is beneficial when working with KubeEdge. KubeEdge is an adaptation of Kubernetes that aims to support various edge computing scenarios. It leverages core Kubernetes functionalities to manage edge workloads while enabling additional capabilities suited for edge environments.

KubeEdge allows for extending native Kubernetes capabilities to edge devices, enabling them to run, orchestrate, and manage edge workloads. It incorporates Kubernetes into the edge, but having an existing Kubernetes cluster is not a strict requirement to use KubeEdge. However, a solid understanding of Kubernetes concepts, architecture, and operations is certainly advantageous for deploying and managing KubeEdge effectively.
