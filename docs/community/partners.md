# KubeEdge Partners 

KubeEdge works with partners to create a strong, vibrant cloud native edge computing ecosystem. We have a list of [KubeEdge Distributions, Hosted Platforms and Installers](http://kubeedge.io/partners) with deep experience helping enterprises successfully adopt KubeEdge. If your product belongs to any of these categories and you would like to join our community, you are welcome to add your product introduction to the list, helping KubeEdge users quickly find and learn about your offerings. 

To add your product, please follow these steps below:

1. Fork the [kubeedge/website](https://github.com/kubeedge/website) repository.
2. Clone it locally with `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/website.git`.
3. Edit partners list in [src/pages/partners/partners.mdx](https://github.com/kubeedge/website/blob/master/src/pages/partners/partners.mdx) and write your product information in alphabetical order based on the organization/company name. You can refer to the following sample table for the format.

   | Organization/Company   | Product  | Description | Website |
   |:-:|:-:|-------------|---------|
   | The organization/company name which your product belongs to     |   Your product name            | (optional) Description about your product        | https://myproductwebsite     |
