## Mapper-Framework
Mapper-Framework provides a new Mapper development framework, which integrates DMI device data management 
(data plane) capabilities, allowing devices to process data at the edge or in the cloud, 
improving the flexibility of device data management. Mapper-Framework can automatically generate users' Mapper projects, 
simplify the complexity of user design and implementation of Mapper, and improve Mapper development efficiency.

## Architecture
![mapper framework](/img/device/mapper-framework.png)

1. Mapper-Framework provide a data push interface for pushing to user applications, the destination rule are defined through CRD.
2. Mapper-Framework provide a database interface that can save data to database, the push rule are defined through CRD.
3. Mapper-Framework provide the REST API, these APIs can access devices to obtain data. API does not support changing device property, 
because this will result in Inconsistent messages between cloud and edge.
4. Mapper-Framework provide device driver interfaces to initialize the device and obtain device data.
5. Mapper-Framework provide Makefile that can generate a mapper with one command.

DMI device management plane and device data plane can be implemented by mapper-framework,Developers only need to focus on device drivers.
The red part in generator (Driver) means that developers need to implement it.
Defined interfaces DevPanel to manage devices, new interfaces will be added when features are added.

## Details
### Data Stream

#### Data Normalization

In order to transfer data between interface modules, standardization of data is necessary. 
These data should contain the necessary information generated by the data.
The standardized data definition is [DataModel](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/staging/src/github.com/kubeedge/mapper-framework/pkg/common/datamodel.go#L4)

#### Push
The data push module can push property values of devices to reachable user apps for consumption according to 
destination rules that defined by CRD. To meet the new requirements, the current v1beta1 CRD definitions of Device 
Instance add new fields [PushMethod](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/pkg/apis/devices/v1beta1/device_instance_types.go#L116)

An example of a configuration file that defines mapper to push data to user applications is as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: devices.kubeedge.io/v1beta1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: beta1-device
spec:
  deviceModelRef:
    name: beta1-model
  nodeName: worker-node1
  properties:
    - name: temp
      pushMethod:
        mqtt:
          address: tcp://127.0.0.1:1883
          topic: temp
          qos: 0
          retained: false
      ...
```

In the current CRD definition, MQTT and HTTP protocols are supported, and the cycle(default 1s) is defined by 
the `DeviceProperty.ReportCycle`. When mapper is executed, it will automatically parse the value of the `pushMethod` field 
and execute the `DataPanel` interface to push data.  
In the future, `DataPanel` interface will add more interfaces to ensure data security.

#### DataBase
The database module can store device data to a local database 
according to destination rules that defined by [DBMethod](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge/blob/master/pkg/apis/devices/v1beta1/device_instance_types.go#L155).
An example of a configuration file that defines mapper to push data to user database is as follows:
```yaml
apiVersion: devices.kubeedge.io/v1beta1
kind: Device
metadata:
  name: beta1-device
spec:
  deviceModelRef:
    name: beta1-model
  nodeName: worker-node1
  properties:
    - name: temp
      pushMethod:
         dbMethod:
            influxdb2:
               influxdb2ClientConfig:
                  url: http://127.0.0.1:8086
                  org: test-org
                  bucket: test-bucket
               influxdb2DataConfig:
                  measurement: stat
                  tag:
                     unit: temperature
                  fieldKey: beta1test
      ...
```

Now we provide Influx2,Redis,TDengine database interfaces, we will add more databases later.

#### Pull
The HTTP server was created to provide API services. It supports directly obtaining device data from the device.
The URLs listed below are given in the form of local IP. You can use these services from any network accessible to mapper.

Port `7777` is enabled by default.

`deviceInstance-ID` according to your own CRD definition
`propertyName` according to your own CRD definition

#### Ping
1. Detect whether the RESTful service starts normally  
   Method: **GET**  
   Url: https://127.0.0.1:7777/api/v1/ping  
   Response:
   ```json
   {
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "statusCode": 200,
    "timeStamp": "2023-08-18T09:57:29+08:00",
    "Message": "This is v1 API, the server is running normally."
    }
   ```
#### Device Data
1. Get device's Data  
   Method=**GET**  
   Url: https://127.0.0.1:7777/api/v1/device/deviceInstance-ID/propertyName 
   Response:
